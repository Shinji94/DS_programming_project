Nice work!

== Python Code ==

- The code does not follow an OOP-based design

- It is normally better to randomly shuffle the dataset before each epoch of sgd (the sgd function is also perhaps too similar to the online reference, but I see that you did a lot of work around it)

- The ensemble code for multiple labels is interesting. However, the aggregation part seems to be done outside any method/function, and is fixed to only 3 classifiers.

- It would be good to show a simple example as a test case, or show if the training accuracy/error is dropping with the number of epochs

== Analysis ==

Great work!

- Precision and recall could still be evaluated in a multi-class problem, but it would be with respect to one specific class.

- I see one statistical comparison in Table 3-1, but perhaps it would be good to do more statistical evaluations, regressions, show error bars in the graphs, etc.

== Text ==

- The font size is sometimes too small. It would be better to generate a smaller image, instead of generating a large one and re-scaling.

- A few minor issues, e.g.:

-- "With a accuracy"

-- "1.3 relate works"

-- "a new object will be label to the class"

-- "among the four model"

-- "A 10-fold cross validation method has been shown been shown y Kohavi et al. (1995)"

-- "time consuming problem should take into considered"

"It is good to see the confidence intervals in Table 3-1, but you give too many decimal places.

Some of the results in the table on page 10 are presented to too many decimal places.

Some of the plots on page 8 are really too small in your report."
